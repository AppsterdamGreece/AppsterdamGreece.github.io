We wish you all happy holidays, and for those who celebrate Christmas, we hope you are spending it with the people you love.

For Appsterdam Greece, 2013 has been an amazing year. It was the year we kicked into gear and started rolling out more of the events we have in Amsterdam.

The [first of these][First Guru Session] are the Guru Sessions, informal hands on workshops for the community by the community.
We will host the second one on January 11th where [Yannis Gravezas] will introduce you to the world of NUI in the [Natural User Interfaces 101 Session][NUI Guru Session], you do't want to miss it.

We also introduced our first "made in Greece" session with the [Appsterdam Open Source Software Launch Party][Appsterdam OSS Launch Party], an event we hope to host more often during 2014.

As we roll out more and more events in Greece we also want to expand our focus from Athens to more of Greece. As many of the core members from Athens travelled home to fix their parents computers, it seems like a great moment to bring everybody together. So coming Saturday we will have a small get together in Thessaloniki.

We will meet at [Cantina Tropicana, Egnatia 31 in Thessaloniki][Cantina Tropicana] from 16:00 till the last one leaves. Feel free to share the [Facebook event] and invite all your friends.

Hope to see you there and enjoy the rest of the holidays.
