## The International Speaker Stage

Appsterdam Greece is happy to announce the International Speaker Stage, a line of events and lectures that will host international members of the worldwide Appsterdam community in Athens, Greece.

As Appsterdammers travel around the world to work with each other, present on conference stages and hang out with their peers, we will pull them into Athens so you can meet them, pick their brains and show off all the great things Athens has to offer.

We start with Saul Mora ([@casademora](https://twitter.com/casademora)). Saul came to visit Appsterdam in Amsterdam in 2011, when it all just started, and has been dropping by on regular basis ever since. 

This year he decided to check out the Greek Embassy, meet the people, enjoy the food and give a talk before he travels to Amsterdam to present at [MDevCon](http://mdevcon.com).

## Wednesday 5th of March at 19.00 at [The Cube Athens](http://thecube.gr).

Saul Mora will give a talk about "What’s the Next Big Thing for Mobile?" at [The Cube Athens](http://thecube.gr).
