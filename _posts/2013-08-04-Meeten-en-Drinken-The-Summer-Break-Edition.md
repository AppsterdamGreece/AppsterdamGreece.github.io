Last Wednesday, July 31st, Appsterdam Greece hosted a special edition of [Meeten en Drinken](https://www.facebook.com/events/484916398268402 'Facebook event page').

At [Caf√© La Rambla](https://www.facebook.com/pages/La-Rambla/160202257374396 'Cafe La Rambla in Athens') in Athens around 45 App Makers gathered to meet each other, have a drink and say hi and goodbey before everybody will go to their vaction destination.

It was great to see all the familiar and new faces and we will be sure to continue the Weekly Meeten en Drinken from September onwards.
