## About The Event

Appsterdam Guru Sessions are informal, very hands-on workshops to share a technology or a technique between App Makers. Explanation from your peers, open discussion and practical experience are key to these sessions.

Appsterdam Greece will host it's first Guru Session on Saturday December 14th.


### Demystifying Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence or AI, may seem like a daunting topic to get started with.

But what are the mechanics of AI, what do you type, what are the basic ingredients you need to know about?

In this session Konstantinos Kostis of [SciFY] will introduce you to basics of AI.

During the session you will be writing a spam filter from scratch and in doing so, you will get to know all about the jargon and the mechanics of machine learning. And although we can not cover everything, you should go home with enough understanding and muscle memory to start messing around with interesting, useful and current discipline of computer science.

We open the doors at 10:00am and start at 11:00am sharp. There are limited seats available, so make sure you get [your ticket][Ticket].

Lunch, snacks and drinks will be provided. To cover the costs we charge €6.00 per person, you can pay at the door.

### Bring Your Laptop!

You should bring you laptop. We will provide information over the week about what you should have installed.

But don't worry, there will be several people who can help you get set up during the event. Just make sure you arrive in time so they can help you.
