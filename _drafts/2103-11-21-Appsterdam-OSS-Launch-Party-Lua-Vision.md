We are happy to announce the first Appsterdam OSS Launch Party. We hope it will be the first of many.

On Thursday, December 5th, [Giannis Gravezas] will launch and present [Lua Vision].

## The Evening

You are welcome to join on Thursday, December 5th, from 21:00 EST at [Stone Soup] in Athens.

[Giannis Gravezas] will kick of the evening by presenting [Lua Vision], what it is, how it works and how you can contribute.

We will provide several workstations with [Lua Vision] installed connected to a [Kinect] and a projector, and, off course, you can bring your own machine. We will help you get set up, answer any queston and show you what the module is capable of.

We will provide some drinks and snacks and will accept donations to share in the costs.

## Lua Vision, an Open Source Kinect module in Lua

[Lua Vision] is a module that provides facilities for using depth data in [Lua].
It's main target is the primesense chipset which powers the Microsoft [Kinect].

[Lua Vision] is aimed at both coders and artist who want to create artistic and academic visuals driven by the [Kinect].

The module features:

* Triple buffering in a background thread handling frame delivery
* simultaneous access of the depth frames from multiple threads
* A fast blob tracking engine for basic analysis of the frames
* Access to the raw depth data for further use eg with skeltrack
* It uses the buffers provided from the void module or LuaJit FFI
