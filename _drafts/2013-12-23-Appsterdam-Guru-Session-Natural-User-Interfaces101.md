## About The Event

Appsterdam Guru Sessions are informal, very hands-on workshops to share a technology or a technique between App Makers. Explanation from your peers, open discussion and practical experience are key to these sessions.

Appsterdam Greece will host it's second Guru Session on Saturday January 11th of 2014.


### Exploring Natural User Interfaces

Natural User Interfaces is an umbrella term for a variety of technologies that enable users to interact with computers in human terms.

Their use becomes all the more relevant as the internet of things materializes, and computers become invisible aids to our daily lives.

NUI is for input what graphics is for output so among these technologies, the visual feedback ones are the most prominent and powerful.

But what are the basic principles behind computer vision, and how can one actually develop apps with it?

In this session [Yannis Gravezas] will introduce you to the basics of computer vision and NUI development using the MS Kinect.

During the session you will be writing a visual application for hand tracking from scratch and in doing so, you will get to know all about the jargon and the mechanics of computer vision. And although we can not cover everything, you should go home with enough understanding and muscle memory to start messing around with this interesting, useful and current discipline of computer science.

We open the doors at 10:00am and start at 11:00am sharp. There are limited seats available, so make sure you get [your ticket][Ticket].

Lunch, snacks and drinks will be provided. To cover the costs we charge €6.00 per person, you can pay at the door.

### Bring Your Laptop!

You should bring your laptop. We will provide information over the week about what you should have installed.

But don't worry, there will be several people who can help you get set up during the event. Just make sure you arrive in time so they can help you.

If you don't have laptop to bring, lets us know via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AppsterdamGr) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/AppsterdamsGreekEmbassy).
